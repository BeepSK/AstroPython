This mini guide tells you how to use the data here.
Firstly, you can use the csv file to upload the data for the exoplanetary data I have used in the project. The other datasets don't require any such files as I have uploaded them directly to the project. 
Other than this, You can use this python file on jupyter or colab. I have used both to check how the code works. 
Keep in mind, keep the google colab option at the very beginning of the code as markdown so that it doesn't interfere when you are using jupyter. I have also kept the installation of Async PRAW in markdown but you should remove it to download the directory.
That's all! Feel free to give me advice for similar future projects :)
